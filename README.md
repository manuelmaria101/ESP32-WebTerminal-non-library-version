After this you must connect to the WiFi network wich has the *ssid* that you choose for your AP (*default = "RAFL_AP"*) and write the password (*default = "raflnet123"*).

When the connection has been established sucessfully you can open your browser and go to the IP address that you collected before and you have yourself a web terminal.
